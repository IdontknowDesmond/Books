	 There are mutiple types of computer cluster applications, for instance file server, web hosting, and data processing, but the one I will be discussing is load balancing. I want to inform  you about load balancing, because I think it is the best choice for this business. 
	Load balancing is a great option to use, because ot distributes and balances the workload between the nodes on the servers. With the workload being seperated between the servers it improves the performance rate. Load balancing takes HTTP request and forwards the request to the server. Load balancing also avoids over working and overstrassing a single node, and it does this by splitting up the work load and traffic flow between all the nodes on the server. It routes the traffic and workload, and guides the request across the servers to fullfill and complete the task. 
	There are mutiple advantages to using load balancing. It reduces the downtime, with it distrubting the worload. It is scalable, by being able to reduce or increase the workload, and nodes on the server.
