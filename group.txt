Masturbate to the point of injury
Lived a double life, friends looked up to their relationship but they didn't know what was really hapening
Day before his daughters birthday got arrested
Diference between soberity and recovery
Setting up an emergercy plan and putting that plan into action
soberity absences from things not suppose to do
Recovery makes my life better, doing the steps will guide me
Continues to mediate and pray
When he has an acting out thought he thinks it through

 Men's Group
Turn his life over to his addiction
Lost friends Wide kids
Lost his Freedom
If he could do all of that why not do it do something positive
Stop a person from being treated like a person
Gets in his own head and it's a challegene
Able to stay present with his family
Acted out in ways he is not happy with.

Even thoughout all the years he still has to reach out
Important to make calls even when not feeling triggered
-To get away from the trouble
Be nicer to hisself 
We treat lonelines with isolation
